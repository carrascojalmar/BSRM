### Abstract
Proportional continuous outcomes, bounded in the unit interval (0,1), are commonly modeled using Beta or Simplex regression models. While these approaches are effective for univariate data, they may be inadequate when dealing with correlated proportional responses. To address this limitation, we propose a Bivariate Simplex Regression Model (BSRM) based on the Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM) copula. This model jointly captures the dependence structure between two response variables and simultaneously models both the mean and dispersion parameters. Parameter estimation is conducted via the maximum likelihood method, and the asymptotic properties of the estimators are examined through Monte Carlo simulation studies. Diagnostic tools, including residual analysis and global influence measures such as generalized Cook's distance and the likelihood displacement, are developed to evaluate model adequacy and identify influential observations. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is illustrated through an application to socioeconomic data from municipalities in Alagoas, Brazil.
